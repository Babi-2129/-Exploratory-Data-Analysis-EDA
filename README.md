# Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores the Titanic dataset using Python, with the goal of identifying key patterns, relationships, and trends that influenced survival outcomes.

## 📊 Objective

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to:

- Understand the structure of the data
- Clean and visualize relevant features
- Identify trends and correlations
- Generate insights useful for predictive modeling

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Python 3.13.4
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## 📁 Files Included

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Titanic_EDA.ipynb` | Jupyter Notebook with all code and visualizations |
| `Titanic_EDA.pdf` | Exported report for presentation/sharing |
| `README.md` | This file |

## 📌 Key Steps

1. **Data Loading and Inspection**
   - Used `.info()`, `.describe()`, `.value_counts()`
2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values and formatted columns
3. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Histograms, boxplots for Age, Fare, etc.
4. **Bivariate Analysis**
   - Survival vs Gender, Class, Age groups
5. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Heatmap and pairplot
6. **Insights and Summary**

## 🔍 Insights

- Females had a significantly higher survival rate
- Passengers in 1st class had better chances of survival
- Younger passengers (especially children) had a better chance
- Strong correlation between `Pclass` and `Fare`, and between `Sex` and `Survived`

## 📄 Summary

This EDA provided a solid understanding of the Titanic dataset. The visual analysis highlighted key features for survival prediction and will serve as a foundation for machine learning models in future tasks.
